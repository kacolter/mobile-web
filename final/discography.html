        <h2>Gish</h2>
          <article id="overview">
            <p>
              Gish is the debut studio album by The Smashing Pumpkins and marks the beginning of their rise in the alternative rock scene of the early 1990s. Recorded in Madison, Wisconsin, and produced by Butch Vig (who would later work on Nirvana's Nevermind), Gish showcased the band's unique sound—a fusion of heavy guitars, psychedelic textures, and emotional depth.
            </p>
            <p>
              Though it wasn't an immediate commercial success, Gish became the highest-selling independent album of the year and helped the band build a dedicated underground following. Its dynamic blend of dream pop, hard rock, and shoegaze influences set the stage for their later breakthrough.

              <dd>“Rhinoceros” is a dreamy, slow-burning track from The Smashing Pumpkins' debut album Gish (1991). Blending soft, hypnotic verses with bursts of heavy, distorted guitar, the song showcases the band's early mastery of dynamics and mood. With its swirling layers, emotional depth, and cryptic lyrics, “Rhinoceros” became a fan favorite and a signature example of the Pumpkins' unique mix of psychedelic rock and grunge.</dd>

              <dd>Driven by a powerful, chugging guitar riff and urgent drumming, the song introduces the band's blend of aggressive alt-rock and introspective themes.

        <h2>Siamese Dream</h2>
          <article id="overview">
            <p>Siamese Dream is the second studio album by The Smashing Pumpkins and a landmark release in 1990s alternative rock. Following the underground success of their debut Gish, the band returned with an ambitious and emotionally charged album that helped catapult them into mainstream success.
            </p>
            <p>
              The recording process was famously intense. Billy Corgan, struggling with depression and perfectionism, took control of much of the instrumentation—reportedly re-recording many of the guitar and bass parts himself. Despite internal band tensions, the result was a dense, layered album that fused grunge, psychedelia, shoegaze, and progressive rock into a unique sound.

              <dd>With its bright, jangly guitar riff and upbeat melody, the song contrasts sharply with its dark lyrical content, which reflects themes of despair and emotional numbness.

          <article id="overview">
            <p>
              Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness is a double album—and a sprawling musical statement—by The Smashing Pumpkins, released at the height of their fame in 1995. Spanning 28 tracks across two discs (titled Dawn to Dusk and Twilight to Starlight), the album blends elements of alternative rock, orchestral pop, metal, punk, and dream pop into a deeply emotional and musically diverse experience.
            </p>
            <p>
              Thematically, the album explores youth, mortality, love, despair, and rebirth. Billy Corgan envisioned it as the "The Wall for Generation X," and its grand scope and ambition earned both critical praise and commercial success.
